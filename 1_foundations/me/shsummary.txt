My name is Kunwar Shaurya Pratap Singh. I’m a designer and front-end developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science, currently pursuing a CSE specialization in AI and Data Engineering at VIT Vellore as my only branch in college. While my core expertise lies in UI/UX design, I work across multiple design domains — including product design, web design, visual design, branding, and interactive experiences — allowing me to approach problems with both creativity and technical logic.
I’m currently interning at MyPerro, where I design intuitive digital experiences using Figma and modern web technologies, focusing on usability, scalability, and clean visual systems. I enjoy blending aesthetics with functionality — turning complex ideas into simple, responsive, and engaging user experiences.
I’m particularly passionate about design systems, motion and micro-interactions, and the intersection of design with emerging technologies like AI. Outside of work, I spend time experimenting with new layouts, exploring minimal design trends, and learning tools that help me push creative boundaries.
