My name is Kunwar Shaurya Pratap Singh. I’m a UI/UX designer and front-end developer with a strong foundation in Information Technology. 
I study at VIT, Vellore, and I’m currently interning at MyPerro, where I design intuitive digital experiences using Figma and modern web tools. 
I love blending creativity with logic — turning ideas into clean, responsive designs that feel effortless to use. 
I’m passionate about design systems, animation, and thoughtful user interactions. When I’m not designing, you’ll probably find me 
experimenting with new web layouts, watching tech-inspired videos, or exploring minimal aesthetic design trends.
